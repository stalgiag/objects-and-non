#### During Class
- Mutability Discussion
- Photogrammetry Demo
- Artist Lecture (Mutable V. Immutable)


#### Before Next Class
- Develop an idea for an artwork
  - One of these binaries can serve as a useful jumping off point:
      - Subject v. Object
      - Material v. Immaterial
      - Mutable v. Immutable
      - Connected v. Disconnected
      - Object v. Non-Object
  - This artwork can be based on prior work, it can also be an adaptation of an ongoing project
  - The project should be scoped so that it can be completed for critique in 1 month
  - The project can be a segment of a larger work (such as thesis) but it should be scoped so that a discrete segment can be completed for critique in 1 month

- Prepare a proposal presentation for your artwork
  - The presentation should be roughly 5 minutes in duration
  - You should have at least 5 slides
  - You should explain both the themes and methodology in the work
  - You should present a timeline that breaks down the project into 4 one-week milestones
  - You should outline what the main challenges will be
  - You should explain how this work is situated in your past work
  - You should tell us how the work will live in the world (as video, as a site-specific installation, as a one-time performance, as a website with photo documentation, etc ...)
  - If the project is time-based and will be longer than 10 minutes, tell us how you will present for critique (send video before class for viewing outside of class, show us an edited version so we can view in a limited timeframe, etc)

- Bring your proposal to next class
  - you will screenshare and present your idea, again the duration is 5 minutes
  - we will offer feedback for 5 minutes
